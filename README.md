# Numerical Computation

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for topics in numerical
computation using Python.  I will be using the notebooks interactively
in class and adding to it incrementally.  You can
[install Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
locally to interact with this notebook and to edit it.

Comments, bug reports, and contributions welcome via pull request or
opening issues.
